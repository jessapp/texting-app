# Share Some Panda Facts

Share Some Panda Facts is a project created to become acquainted with the Twilio API. It allows users to enter a phone number, and receive a text message containing a random fact about pandas. 

At this time, the app uses the Twilio API on the free trial tier, which means it cannot connect to most phone numbers. However, the project may be expanded to accomodate other phone numbers in the future.
